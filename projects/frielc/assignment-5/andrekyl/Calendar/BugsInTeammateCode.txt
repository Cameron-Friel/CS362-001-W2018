Bug 1

The first bug I found was in the Appt java file. This bug was uncovered by testing a month which
comes after a month that has less days than it with a start day input that it larger than the maximum
preceding month's maximum day. I caught on to this bug when I ran through my tests and noticed that a
test that had worked in my files did not in my teammate's. This lead me to see that my assertion that
that test would work when it actually failed. After further observation it could be seen that the
only way this bug occurred was from what I stated previously. In term of code, this line
int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth); was changed to 
int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth-1);. As can be seen it grabs
the previous month's number of days instead of the month provided creating the bug. 

Bug 2

The second bug I found was in the TimeTable java file. This bug was uncovered by testing for a list
of appointments and deleting the first one in the array making sure that null was returned. This test
failed in my partner's code since I was testing for this case to be null, however, my partner's
expected result was a length of four. This resulted from him changing the starting array bounds from
i = 1 to i = 0 so that the first index could be modified. To be completely honest, I am not sure why
the initial code had it set to this array index in the first place but I digress.
